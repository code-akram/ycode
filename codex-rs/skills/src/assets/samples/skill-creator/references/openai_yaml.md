# openai.yaml fields (full example + descriptions)

`agents/openai.yaml` is an extended, product-specific config intended for the machine/harness to read, not the agent. Other product-specific config can also live in the `agents/` folder.

## Full example

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Optional user-facing name"
  short_description: "Optional user-facing description"
  icon_small: "./assets/small-400px.png"
  icon_large: "./assets/large-logo.svg"
  brand_color: "#3B82F6"
  default_prompt: "Optional surrounding prompt to use the skill with"

policy:
  allow_implicit_invocation: true
```

## Field descriptions and constraints

Top-level constraints:

- Quote all string values.
- Keep keys unquoted.
- For `interface.default_prompt`: generate a helpful, short (typically 1 sentence) example starting prompt based on the skill. It must explicitly mention the skill as `$skill-name` (e.g., "Use $skill-name-here to draft a concise weekly status update.").

- `interface.display_name`: Human-facing title shown in UI skill lists and chips.
- `interface.short_description`: Human-facing short UI blurb (25–64 chars) for quick scanning.
- `interface.icon_small`: Path to a small icon asset (relative to skill dir). Default to `./assets/` and place icons in the skill's `assets/` folder.
- `interface.icon_large`: Path to a larger logo asset (relative to skill dir). Default to `./assets/` and place icons in the skill's `assets/` folder.
- `interface.brand_color`: Hex color used for UI accents (e.g., badges).
- `interface.default_prompt`: Default prompt snippet inserted when invoking the skill.
- `policy.allow_implicit_invocation`: When false, the skill is not injected into
  the model context by default, but can still be invoked explicitly via `$skill`.
  Defaults to true.
