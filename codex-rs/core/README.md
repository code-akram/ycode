# codex-core

This crate implements ycode's Rust CLI business logic on `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

## Dependencies

Note that `codex-core` makes some assumptions about certain helper utilities being available in the environment. Currently, this support matrix is:

### macOS

Expects `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` to be present.

When using the workspace-write sandbox policy, the Seatbelt profile allows
writes under the configured writable roots while keeping `.git` (directory or
pointer file), the resolved `gitdir:` target, and `.codex` read-only.

Network access and filesystem read/write roots are controlled by
`SandboxPolicy`. Seatbelt consumes the resolved policy and enforces it.

Seatbelt also keeps the legacy default preferences read access
(`user-preference-read`) needed for cfprefs-backed macOS behavior.

### Helper dispatch

Expects the binary containing `codex-core` to simulate the virtual
`apply_patch` CLI when `arg1` is `--codex-run-as-apply-patch`. See the
`codex-arg0` crate for details.
